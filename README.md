FYI. 

- Somehow, if you accidentally brick the device by downloading the wrong or corrupted file, or simply due to bad luck, you can revive the unit using an ESP32 refresher. The catch is that not every refresher on the market is compatible. We’ve tested 4-5 different refreshers before deciding to make our own.

## Warrenty and Tech Support

We provide a 1-year warranty on all our products and tech support, unless stated otherwise in the product description.

FYI, our [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/HoneyHoneyTrading) shop is no longer in operation. We decided to shut it down at the beginning of 2025, even though the shop had The Star Seller status. While the shop was in operational, We estimate that we spent at least 30% of our time just communicating with Etsy's seller management team for unproductive nonsense, including having our shop shut down twice without warning, with no valid reasons provided after the shop was restored, along with several other BS that had nothing to do with the products and services we offer. 

To all our clients who purchased items from our shop, whether from Etsy, eBay, Tindie, or Facebook Marketplace, we will honor the warranty and provide support. Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com. or [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/61452559581)
