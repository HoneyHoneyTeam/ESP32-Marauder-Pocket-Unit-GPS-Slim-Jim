<br/>

1. Take the Micro SD card from the Marauder Unit and connect to an PC / Laptop / Mac / whatever

2. Download the **V6** firmware file, which is usual inclued < **_new_hardware.bin/_v6.bin** > in the name, from [Marauder website](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases).
   
3. Copy the file to the Micro SD card and rename it as< **update.bin** >. Then, insert the Micro SD card back into the Marauder Unit.

4. Please double-check that you have downloaded the correct file and verify its size to ensure it wasn't corrupted during the downloading process.
   
5. Turn on the Marauder Unit Navigating menu as following: < **Device** > => < **Update firmware** > => < **SD Update** > => < **Yes** >. 
   
6. In a minute, The unit should restart itself and you are golden.

FYI. 

- Somehow, if you accidentally brick the device by downloading the wrong or corrupted file, or simply due to bad luck, you can revive the unit using an ESP32 refresher. The catch is that not every refresher on the market is compatible. We’ve tested 4-5 different refreshers before deciding to make our own. If you find yourself in this situation, Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com. or [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/61452559581) .

## Warrenty and Tech Support

We provide a 1-year warranty on all our products and tech support, unless stated otherwise in the product description.

FYI, our [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/HoneyHoneyTrading) shop is no longer in operation. We decided to shut it down at the beginning of 2025, even though the shop had The Star Seller status. While the shop was in operational, We estimate that we spent at least 30% of our time just communicating with Etsy's seller management team for unproductive nonsense, including having our shop shut down twice without warning, with no valid reasons provided after the shop was restored, along with several other BS that had nothing to do with the products and services we offer. 

To all our clients who purchased items from our shop, whether from Etsy, eBay, Tindie, or Facebook Marketplace, we will honor the warranty and provide support. Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com. or [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/61452559581)

## FAQ 

- **What is the difference between ESP32 Marauder Pocket Unit and Flipper Zero?**
<details>

<br/>  

We get this question quite often.
<br/>  

**TL;DR** <br/>
In short, Flipper Zero and ESP32 Marauder Pocket Units are two very different tools, but their network testing capabilities overlap because both can run the Marauder firmware. If you're heavily involved in network testing, the Marauder is the way to go. Otherwise, Flipper Zero would be a better investment.

**Non-TL;DR**<br/>
Flipper Zero is the jack of all trades but master of none. What’s fascinating about Flipper is how it combines so many functions into such a compact form factor, including SubGHz, RFID, NFC, infrared, iButton, and, most importantly, the endless possibilities for extensions/boards/modules via GPIO.

Flipper itself doesn’t support Wi-Fi out of the box. However, it can extend its network testing capabilities by using extension boards via GPIO. There are quite a few Wi-Fi boards available for this purpose, including [ours](https://github.com/HoneyHoneyTeam/3in1-WIFI-MultiBoard-with-Screen). At a fundamental level, most of these boards work in a very similar way. Additionally, most of the Wi-Fi boards run the Marauder firmware, which enhances their capabilities for Wi-Fi pen-testing.

As for the ESP32 Marauder Pocket Units, they are primarily focused on Wi-Fi pen-testing via Marauder firmware, just like the Wi-Fi boards for Flipper Zero. However, with a 2.8-inch screen, the Marauder Pocket Unit provides much more real-time information compared to the small screen on Flipper Zero. Plus, the Marauder Pocket Unit comes with GPS, a larger battery, Bluetooth, and more—features that Flipper lacks. As a result, it can offer up to 15% more functionality than Flipper Zero in this area.
